	Being a CSE Major, I learned to use vim my somphome year in college and since then it has been my favorite editor. I use it whenever I can. I made a big .vimrc file which serves me well (for instance, vim doesn't like the double Ls because I use them to jump over paranthesis). I am grateful for how vim makes me more effective. But, I am still lousy in installing plugins for it though.On the contrary, I don't see much in emacs over vim than a split that can contain the terminal for you to run any commands you want. Unfortunately I can't do that with Vim. Therefore, I have jump between my main editting terminal split between different files and another terminal that I can run my code as a programmer.Finally, at work we all tend to use coda which is not very popular, but that is what I use as a web developer. 
	For many years, I have been in love with most of the big ones like Opera, Mozilla, Safari and finally my current browser Chrome. Right now I am more consistant with Chrome and Mozilla to back it up. However, for development I use mainly Chrome to debug my websites, and when I want to have fun, I play with Mozilla's 3D view of the website. 
	Note: I will use JSFiddle for the screenshot because I am working on a terminal on the CSE servers, so I can't drag and drop my file into the browser and I was too lazy to put it in the web directory to show it, I will also have the current website that I tweaked (it is not fully mine) for my CSE 335 class.
