					<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
					<p>We are a non-profit humanitarian aid organization that is based at Michigan State University and led by a diverse group of MSU students. GH2HG focuses on helping countries in desperate need of medical aid. To achieve this goal we have built a strong network of Michigan-based medical professionals, student volunteers and developing countries to collect, sort, ship and redistribute usable medical supplies and equipment.</p>
					<p>GH2HG was founded in October, 2010 as non-profit organization committed to global human health. So far, our shipments have helped bring hope and care to thousands of people in the developing world. In the process, we have reduced waste in the U.S.</p>
