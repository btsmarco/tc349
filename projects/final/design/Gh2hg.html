				<h2>The Study</h2>		
				<img src="img/gh/Gh2hg.png" class="photo"/>
				<p class="para">
I chose to do the study on this website because I want to redesign this website for my final project.

				I applied the Card Sorting technique on the content of gh2hg.org. GH2HG is a non-profit organization on campus that I am a part of (vice president). The content is not distributed well over the pages of the website, so this study was very insightful and helpful.

				<h2>Categories</h2>

				<p class="para">
					The Categories part was not very helpful as the participants had different opinions and were few in number so there was great divergence in the results. Home, Contact us, Multimedia and Projects were agreed upon between the most in the categoris. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Tree graph</h2>

				<p class="para">
					The Tree graph is very helpful in this study. Since the website has a lot of content that are not distributed logically, the participants provided a logical reliable solution. The categories make sense with everything about the story of the organization grouped together and while the multimedia is grouped together and volunteering info and Projects stay independent. The final implementation will probably be a combination of 2 trees, as the one provide a good general layout while the other provide a better specific layout for the info about the organization.

				<h2>Categories X Items</h2>

				<p class="para">
				This was insighful, the most helpful information I got was that Proejects should be its own category, while Feeds and Media should go together (probably a blog) and lastly the two questions why do we do this and what do we do should go together.
				</p>

				<h2>Items X Items</h2>		
				<img src="img/gh/G_itemxitem.png" class="photo"/>
				<p class="para">
				  This category was insightful too, The best bits of information that I got were that 'why we do this' goes with four other questions while who are we, who are our partners and e-board go together well.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>		
				<p class="para">
				  In conclusion, the study was very helpful for the redesign of this website. Although the study didn't work well in the other Foldables.me it worked well here to bring for me insighful.
