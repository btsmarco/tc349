Vimeo is a great video sharing website that never got the recognition they deserve. Vimeo has been working hard on their product since 2004, but never reached the fame its rival Youtube reached. Vimeo is technically sound, and beautifully designed, but it lacks popularity. That’s why when Vimeo wanted to redesign their website they focused on selling themselves well. The Website looks great from the first glance. The variety of great colors is what vimeo is characterized for. The illustrations all over the page gives vimeo a human, personal touch that a lot of websites lack. The illustrations break the intensity of the pursuition throughout the page. Something Vimeo does well is display high quality images and videos to portray the level of clarity and quality they offer. The website is clean, easy to navigate and makes sense in general. 

	Vimeo has a great consistent look and feel throughout the page, from the header to the footer, the page blends in well. The header is merged with the body, but is only separated by a line. The simple white logo, simple navigation are easy to notice against the crazy illustration in the background. The header has a fancy search bar that even includes voice search! While the body is well organized. The body is just as clean and personal as the header, but also informative and persuasive. At the end of the body, Vimeo ends with a similar illustration to the one in the beginning of the page. The ending is sweet, familiar and simple. It feels like Vimeo took you on a tour around and brought you back to the same point again, just like any real world tour. Finally, the footer is small, clean, organized and appropriate to the header and the rest of the page. As a whole, I liked this website the most so far, and I can’t help it but give it 10/10. Vimeo deserves it.
