Etsy is a relatively interesting website. My first impression of it wa that it’s modern, so it is clean and tends to be more flat when it comes to design. Like a lot of the modern websites and the websites we critiqued, etsy had a lot of pictures to communicate and attract customers better. The website is not responsive though. Etsy’s website's left side bar that includes a vertical menu gives it a different taste from the ordinary, although it reminds me of amazon. the middle search bar looks great but could have looked better if it was a bit larger (had a longer height) and had curved edges. With its location and size in mind, it reminds me of amazon’s search bar. Like any well designed website, Etsy has a few good colors that merge well and are used consistently throughout the website. Lastly in the main page, the boxes the hold the products looks good with good amount of information in them

  The product page isn’t very different in terms of the critique, it is also clean and easy to understand. The product page is very familiar which makes it feel normal to use but it has nothing that makes it stand out of the other shopping websites. Overall, I didn’t like the website much. It is not geared towards me so I don’t blame the website. However I believe that the website does a very good job in serving its purpose in selling various good looking products to its customers.
