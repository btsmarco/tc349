The MSU mobile site is a fairly good mobile site, it is designed to do things that spartans (or non spartans) may need to do on the go. It provides functionalities like the search, about, events, maps...etc. The website fits well on mobile phones, so you don’t really need to scroll in the landing page. The website is easy to use because of its clean and flat design. It also uses icons instead of text to refer to other pages. The website in general is consistent, it also uses the same colors used on the main website. I view the website from two mobile devices, one is Samsung focus S (Windows phone) and the other is Nexus 7 (Android). Here are some of my remarks from both devices over different aspects.

WP: I was surprised when I opened it, because the header and the search bar were broken. I think it is an IE bug (which I won’t blame), but it is important to make sure it works on WP devices too.
N7: That’s were I knew the truth and saw the real beauty of the website. 

WP: when I went to msu.edu, it notified me of the mobile site, which was nice.
N7: didn’t notify me.

WP, N7: The search results are very clean and readable (they were better than what I expected). 

WP, N7: On the News page, the headers aren’t very different in style from the description text, so I suggest making it bold or giving it a larger font size.

WP: When I was reading articles about MSU with pictures, the images didn’t take the right size
N7: worked fine.

In general, the website is great. It provides a rich experience and provides all the info someone may need on the go. I give it 8/10.
