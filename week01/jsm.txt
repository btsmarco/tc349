 	The Website for the Graphic Designer Jason Santa Maria is very well designed. I think I could give it 90% overall. To critique it, I will talk about three things. First is design and its cleanness, readability...etc, interactiveness, and finally content. 

	The website is absolutely well designed. I love how clean it is (reminds me of my windows phone). I also really like the contrast between the body and footer of the website. The colors of the website are few and match each other very well. He mainly uses white, two shades of red, black, few shades of gray (not 50!), which are few and look nice all together. Something I didn’t like about the design was some of the fonts, and the thinness of the font used and the arrow used.

	The website was live enough, and by that I mean that it wasn’t a static dead document that you can only read from ( and go to other pages) but you could hover over different pieces of the website (that gives you different color) like the nav bar, the logo, the titles (in summary any link). Although this may not seem to be a brilliant or new idea, yet it is necessary for the professional look of the website. However the highlighting with red on his website was really beautiful. I enjoyed how new it looked to me. Finally, the website is responsive, which makes it, ready for all those tablets and smartphones out there.

Last but not least, The content was good, it had a lot of media files, from images, to videos which always helps you learn. I haven’t read on all the text content of the website because I haven’t read enough in it.
