From the very first glance the Michigan State University’s website is very professional. But I found it hard to critique it may be because I am very used to it. I am not really certain. The website has a clean cut design, not flat (which is trendy now) but good. The nav bar is classic and good, just like the nav on apple’s website. I believe the header as a whole is great, merging the school’s famous colors green and white in a skillful way. Under the nav bar there is another bar that is not styled much (only underlined to show that they are links), I have never used it. I probably never used it because it is very unnoticeable, although it looks like it had helpful collection of links. That nav being unnotieable is beneficial to the clean design but reduces the website’s accessibility (which is a part of a good design).  The large carousel in the middle of the page is probably the reason the website is very engaging and attractive. The website as a whole is “short and sweet”. All the shadow effects and grid effects make it more natural looking. There is nothing great about the footer. A way to make it better is to decrease the blank space by making sure the content has a consistent height. The background color of the footer is very suitable though and blends well with the website’s white background. I would give the website an overall of 8/10.
