					<h2>The critique of the website for "Panic" </h2>
					<p>
						For a long time I have been using Coda and Transmit (although Vim wins) for my job in the State News without knowing that they are made by the same company. At the first glance the website looks colorful and with a lot of graphics. With the logo in the middle of the page and very large font Panic gets their point across well. Yet the design doesn’t really make you “panic” of how good it is, and I don’t really like the color choice from the background to the blue logo and the purple font. They all work together but there is nothing special about them. 

					</p>
					<p>
						On the other hand, I really liked the untraditional feel to the website making it an adventure scrolling down to discover the rest of the page while expecting to find the traditional paragraph form and then get shocked as you don’t find it. Also, The transition from the body to the footer is great, it feels like you are gracefully going down the stairs. It stays consistent with the colorful icons and the center alignment of everything. Something I also noticed is how very tidy and neat the website is, with a distinct page for each product and a clean home page. I would give the website an 8/10 overall.
